Test cases, state diagrams
ALso need to document the source code with descriptions of methods and functions

We cannot rely on the sample. We need to do more than what is listed. 


Talked about how we feel about Hessam's classes.
Lack of direction and clarity

Discussed the GUI. Noted the lack of a clock, which is apparently required but not apparent. 
Our code passed muster. 

Other comments that were apparently not dealt with.
